# How to Get Selected for 42 Network School

To be honest, nobody knows the exact selection process for 42 Network School. However, one clear thing is to do your best and give it your all. Here are some steps that might help you get selected, based on what others have experienced:

## 1. Passing the Piscine

### Do You Pass Enough Projects?
- Passing projects is crucial. Even if you ace (pass) all exams but validate only a few projects, you might fail.

### Do You Do Enough Evaluations?
- The Piscine is about helping others, not just doing your own work. Evaluators (bocal) are busy and not always on campus. They check if you're a good cultural fit by looking at the number of evaluations you do.

### What Are Other Peers' Opinions About You?
- Peer opinions matter. Even perfect candidates who do lots of evaluations, ace exams, and finish rushes can fail if they do things like being late for evaluations or rushing through them.

### Passing the Exams
- This is debatable. Some campuses emphasize the last two exams to show progress, but others understand that some people aren't good at tests and look at exceptions.

### Time Commitment
- Another myth is that 42 looks for an achievement of logging 80 hours every week. This might be considered, do not panic guys haha it's just 11 hours each day, i was doing more than 13 hours. in the campus as you enjoy it there the time flies, you got this ;)
- 
### Doing the Rushes
- There is a myth that passing one rush (not rush0) can ensure you pass the Piscine. This makes sense because rushes are large projects that require teamwork. However, this isn't always the case. Evaluators' strictness varies.


## 2. Other Factors
- The selection team will consider categories mentioned above.
- They also look at the overall strength of your Piscine batch and the availability of workstations on campus.

## Final Tips
- Don't worry too much. You always have a second chance.
- If you fail, consider joining another Piscine in a different country. Many people do this.

## Good Luck!
- Overall, do your best and stay committed. Good luck!
